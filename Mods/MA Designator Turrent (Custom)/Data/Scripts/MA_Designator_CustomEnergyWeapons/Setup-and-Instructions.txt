# Custom Energy Weapons System - Setup and Instructions

This script package can be used to give your modded energy weapons a variety of effects, such as different types of damage and grid interactions, ammo generation at the cost of grid energy, configurable upgrade values, and a wide range of visual effects for the weapon!

# Setup

1. Copy the contents of the Scripts folder to your mod Scripts folder.

2. In the file & folder names, replace the text `YourModName` with a unique name (ideally, the name of your mod).

3. Inside all the script files, replace the same `YourModName` text with the same name you used in step 2.

4. Find the `YourWeaponName_Logic` file. Replace the text `YourWeaponName` with the name of the weapon you want to add the effects to.

5. Inside the `YourWeaponName_Logic`, replace the text `YourWeaponName` with the name of the weapon you used in the step above.

6. Near the top of the script, you will want to change the `MyObjectBuilder_LargeGatlingTurret` text (found in the line starting with `[MyEntityComponentDescriptor`) to the object builder value that matches the weapon you're modifying. A list of all the valid object builders can be found above that line.

7. While on that same line, you'll also want to add the SubtypeId of the weapon as well. If you want multiple weapons to use the same effects/settings, you can specify multiple weapon subtypes here following the layed out format: (eg: "SubtypeA", "SubtypeB", "SubtypeC", "etc")

8. Further down the document, navigate or search for the text `CONFIGURATION START`. The section below this text is where you can configure all the effects and settings of the weapon. Each setting has a comment beside it, detailing what functionality it provides.

9. To setup other weapons with unique effects, download another copy of the `YourWeaponName_Logic.cs` file from this repository, and process it by repeating steps 3-8.

# Instructions

While setting up your weapon definition files (CubeBlocks, Weapons, AmmoMagazines, Ammos), there are a few details you'll want to keep in mind:

* Your Ammo (Ammos.sbc file) should be projectile based (non-missile). 
* The Ammo definintion should follow a format similar to this if you plan to use the beam effects (this is because the effects and damage are handled and configured in the script): 
```
		<Ammo xsi:type="MyObjectBuilder_ProjectileAmmoDefinition">
			<Id>
				<TypeId>AmmoDefinition</TypeId>
				<SubtypeId>UniversalAdvancedEnergyChargeAmmo</SubtypeId>
			</Id>
			<BasicProperties>
				<DesiredSpeed>40000</DesiredSpeed>
				<SpeedVariance>0</SpeedVariance>
				<MaxTrajectory>5</MaxTrajectory>
				<BackkickForce>0</BackkickForce>
				<PhysicalMaterial>GunBullet</PhysicalMaterial>
			</BasicProperties>
			<ProjectileProperties>
				<ProjectileTrailScale>0</ProjectileTrailScale>
				<ProjectileHitImpulse>0</ProjectileHitImpulse>
				<ProjectileMassDamage>0</ProjectileMassDamage>
				<ProjectileHealthDamage>0</ProjectileHealthDamage>
				<HeadShot>true</HeadShot>
			</ProjectileProperties>
		</Ammo>
```
* If you are using the script's ammo regeneration features on your weapons, then you can actually use the same ammo/ammo magazine for all of your weapons. Even though the ammo would be the same, the damage and effects can be configured to be different in the script setup. 
* While the weapon definition (Weapons.sbc) has a field for the weapon firing, the script also has one as well, in case multiplayer issues prevent the weapon definition sound from playing. The script field is fairly reliable.
